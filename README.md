Going beyond 2 chips

===

This project is an attempt to extend the highly successful OSHW Nanofury Project to the max.

===

My aim is to create a design that is essentially a modular extension of the NF1. If you have 3 chips, then solder on parts for 3 chips. An additional benefit to this modularity is the ability to tune the voltage to each chip individually to maximize for performance or efficiency.
If you have enough for a full board solder on parts for a full board. The idea is modularity.
